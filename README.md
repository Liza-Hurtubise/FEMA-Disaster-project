 FEMA Disaster Declaration EDA 

This project uses data from all US FEMA disaster declarations from 1953-2022, including disaster type, disaster start/end dates, location of the disaster (by state, and other geographic units of measurement), and FEMA closeout dates.

The Excel file contains the raw data, an interactive dashboard with slicer and timeline functionality, a sheet with my personal observations, a drill down table for Texas data specifically, and accompanying pivot tables.
